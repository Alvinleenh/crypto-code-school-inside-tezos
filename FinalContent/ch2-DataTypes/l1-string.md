> Python is dynamically-typed language, which means it is not required to mention datatype with the variable and once we initialize the variable, it's type is defined then. The same concept is followd with SmartPy as well, but in some cases, we may define the datatype to variables for the sake of security. 

> SmartPy supports all the primitive datatypes.

> string datatype in smartPy are declared as:
`sp.string("")` 
or 
`sp.TString`

Tasks:

Declare a name variable for your plant.
`self.init(name = _name)`
