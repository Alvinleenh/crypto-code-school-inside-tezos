> Details about boolean datatype in smartpy
> sp.bool, sp.TBool

```python
sp.TBool, sp.TNat, sp.TIntOrNat 
```

> In smartPy, all the bitwise operators work the ame way as in python, so for example, `True == ~False` is correct in smartPy as well.

> Your character will have a boolean attribute `isDead` with the initial value as `False` basic attributes, attack, defence and health

Task : 

declare the `isDead` attribute 

`self.init(name = _name, attack = sp.int(0), defence = sp.int(0), health = sp.int(100), growth_rate = sp.int(5), is_alive = True)`
