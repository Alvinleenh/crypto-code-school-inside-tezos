# Game overview

A zombie apocalypse has begun. You’ve luckily found the seed of a plant that is known to stop zombies. Your task is to incubate the seed and help it evolve before the zombies reach you. In the lesson, you’re going to learn how to evolve your plant and train it to defend against the incoming apocalypse.

The seed evolves to a plant as the user progresses through the chapters. Completing the lesson results in the user playing an (optional, small) interactive game where the plant defeats the zombies (this is synonymous to a google doodle with infinite attempts and the user will most likely win this easy game).

- No currency/points as it distracts from the lesson. A direct reward is received after completing the chapter.
- Scope to add potions/accessories received after completing a chapter
