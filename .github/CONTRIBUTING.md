# Contributing Guidelines

## Labels & Milestones

We use [labels](https://github.com/buidl-labs/zombies-in-the-room/labels) to manage PRs and issues and communicate the state of a PR. Please familiarize yourself with them. Furthermore we are organizing issues in [milestones](https://github.com/buidl-labs/zombies-in-the-room/milestones) and [projects](https://github.com/buidl-labs/zombies-in-the-room/projects).

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

- `master` must always be deployable(**No pushing directly to the master branch**).
- **All changes** must be made in a pull-request through a feature branch
- rebase continually from `develop` branch (before beginning work on a feature branch) to avoid/resolve conflicts;
- merge feature branches into integration(develop) branch with `--no-ff` flag.
- Merged into `develop` != In `production`
- Contributors should adhere to the [Workflow](https://github.com/buidl-labs/zombies-in-the-room/wiki/Git-Workflow) and [Naming conventions and best practices](https://github.com/buidl-labs/zombies-in-the-room/wiki/Git-naming-conventions-and-best-practices).
