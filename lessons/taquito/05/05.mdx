### Intro
Everything on the blockchain costs.
Each contract you deploy, each byte you store, each operation you perform - everything costs.

Wouldn't you want to know how much will it cost you to originate a smart contract?
Like you don't buy a t-shirt without checking the price, do you?

### Study time

Taquito's estimate method can be used to estimate fees, gas and storage associated with an operation, even originating a contract is an operation.

```javascript=
Tezos.estimate.originate({
    code: CODE_JSON,
    init: STORAGE_JSON
})
.then(opEstimate=> {
    console.log(opEstimate)
})
```
You need to pass the `CODE_JSON` and `STORAGE_JSON` for the contract that you grabbed in the previous chapter, and it returns the following properties - 

- `burnFeeMutez`: The number of Mutez that will be burned for the storage of the operation.
- `gasLimit`: The limit on the amount of gas a given operation can consume.
- `minimalFeeMutez`: Minimum fees required for the operation according to baker defaults.
- `storageLimit`: The limit on the amount of storage an operation can use. Returns a number.
- `suggestedFeeMutez`: The suggested fee for the operation which includes minimal fees and a small buffer.
- `totalCost`: The sum of minimalFeeMutez + burnFeeMutez. Returns a number.
- `usingBaseFeeMutez`: Fees according to your specified base fee will ensure that at least minimum fee is used.


You can even check the balance available in your account through Taquito -
```javascript=
Tezos.tz
  .getBalance("<YOUR_ADDRESS>")
  .then(balance => console.log(`${balance.toNumber() / 1000000} êœ©`))
  .catch(error => console.log(JSON.stringify(error)));
```
We're dividing the balance by 1000000 because, it returns the balance in **mutez**, to convert it to **tez** - we divide it with 1000000.

### #buidl-ing time
 
#### New feature request!
It's time for the moment of truth, let's see how much it costs to originate our contract.

#### Step by step walkthrough
1. Pass in the `CODE_JSON` as `code` and `STORAGE_JSON` as `init`.
2. Log to the console `totalCost` required for the operation.
