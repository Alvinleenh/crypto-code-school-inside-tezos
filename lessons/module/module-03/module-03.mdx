# Time to rebuild
The aliens have been blown to smithereens.
The threat has been banished, forever.
You did it young warrior, with your technical prowess you've managed to save this world of grave danger.

But, the war has left the current world in tatters. 
No system, no society, no government in place. All is gone. 

The responsibility is yours to give the new-world a structure and build a society of your own! 
A new society, where tokens running on blockchain are the de-facto currency and Cryptobots are the labor reserve.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to make your own tokens.
