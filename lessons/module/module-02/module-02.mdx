# Another wave is incoming!
You managed to fend off the first wave of alien invasion.
But, there's a wave of nastier and meaner aliens right around the corner.

I know you're ready to charge into battle, but your Cryptobot isn't powerful enough to beat the next wave of aliens that's incoming.

Worry not, the inter-galactic Market is here to rescue you with special powerups!

In this lesson, we'll learn how your Cryptobot smart contract can talk to the Market contract through inter-contract calling.
By the end, you'll be able to avail powerups like one-shot kill and time freeze!
