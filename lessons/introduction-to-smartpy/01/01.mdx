Welcome aboard **learners** and **#build-ers**! 

This is is the beginning of **Lesson 1** of **Crypto Plants vs Zombies** - an interactive code school that teaches you how to write smart contracts in SmartPy! 

## Prerequisites for the course 
The course only expects you to be familiar with the following: 

1. You are generally familiar with software development, writing code, and running your code.
2. You have working knowledge of Python and it‚Äôs basic concepts. 


## What will you build or #buidl? 

In the [previous chapter](/tezos/storyline), you got the **seed** of a fabled plant that can kill zombies! Your task will be to evolve it into a full featured plant that can kill zombies like shown below: 

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/lPS3b0XePyBxiX2uUq/giphy.gif" alt="drawing" style="display: block;width: 80%; margin: 40px auto"/>


To build the zombie-killer plant, you are going to learn to write a basic **`Plant` smart contract** that will contain all the abilities required to kill zombies in style! 

Don't worry if you are not familiar with the terminology of "smart contracts" as you will be learning about them in [Chapter 2](/lesson/chapter-02). 

By the end of lesson 1, your `Plant` will: 

1. have the ability to **move around to hunt zombies**!
2. have the ability to **shoot bullet seed to kill zombies**!
3. have the ability to **record zombie kills for post kill analysis**! 

In later lessons, we‚Äôll add more functionality like evolving the `Plant` to have the ability to shoot special moves, the ability to trade your plant with other #builder-s on the planet etc. 



## What to do if I get lost and need help?
No worries! 

If you get lost, we recommend using the curriculum index present at the bottom left corner of your screen to reorient yourself.
