Before we start evolving our plant, allow us to give you a quick primer on: 
* What are smart contracts, anyway? 
* What is SmartPy? 

## What are smart contracts, anyway? 
Smart contracts are scripts stored on a blockchain that enable users to define custom rules and protocols for various purposes. Some typical examples include escrow accounts, insurance-like contracts, decentralized applications — frequently called dApps, multi-signatures (multi-sig) contracts, security tokens, and virtual or physical tokenized assets.

## What is Smartpy?

By default, smart contracts on Tezos are written in Michelson, but it is an hard to learn low level formal language. SmartPy is a high-level smart contract library in Python that offers a simple, intuitive and powerful syntax, enabling developers to easily define Michelson smart contracts for the Tezos blockchain.

## Enough talk, let's code:
Let's start evolving our plant! All SmartPy source code should start by importing the `smartpy` library. 
In the box to the right type out the following statement to import the library: 

```python
import smartpy as sp
```
