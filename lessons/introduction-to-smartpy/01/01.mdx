#### Welcome aboard **learners** and **#build-ers** to Lesson 1 of Crypto Plants vs Zombies - an interactive code school that teaches you how to write smart contracts in Smartpy! 

## Prerequisites for the course 
The course only expects you to be familiar with the following: 

1. You are generally familiar with software development, writing code, and running your code.
2. You have working knowledge of Python and it’s basic concepts. 


## What will you build? 

In lesson 1, you are going to build a `Plant` contract that will act as the incubator of the seed that you just got from the school. 


By the end of lesson 1, your `Plant` will: 

1. have the ability to move around to hunt zombies!
2. have the ability to shoot bullet seed to kill zombies!
3. have the ability to record zombie kills for post kill analysis. 

In later lessons, we’ll add more functionality like evolving the `Plant` to have the ability to shoot special moves, the ability to trade your plant with other #builder-s on the planet etc.
