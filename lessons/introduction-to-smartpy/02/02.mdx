In Lesson 1, you're going to incubate your plant to fight against zombie apocalypse at end of the lesson.

A zombie apocalypse has begun. You’ve luckily found the seed of a plant that is known to stop zombies. Your task is to incubate the seed and help it evolve before the zombies reach you. In the lesson, you’re going to learn how to evolve your plant and train it to defend against the incoming apocalypse by building a simple smart contract in SmartPy which can be deployed on tezos blockchain.
