Starting with the absolute basics:

The fundamental component of any smart contract application is a `contract`. All `variables` and `functions` belong to a `contract`, and this will be the starting point of all your projects/DApps.

An basic contract definition for the contract `HelloWorld` would look like this: 

An empty `contract` named `HelloWorld` would look like this:
```python
class HelloWorld(sp.Contract):
    pass
```

As you can see: 
* we define a Python class and name it  `HelloWorld`. 
* in brackets we inherit the `Contract` class from SmartPy library, the library that we imported in the previous chapter. 

This class will represent our smart contract and enclose all of the storage initialization, entry points.

## Put it to code: 
After incubating the seed, the next step is create the basic structure of the cryto plant, which will be enhancing in the coming chapters. 

Steps: 

1. Declare a `class` named `Plant`.
2. Extend the `Plant` class by inheriting `Contract` class from `smartpy` library.
