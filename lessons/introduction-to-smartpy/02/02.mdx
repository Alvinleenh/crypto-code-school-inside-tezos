In this chapter, we will start to define our `Plant` contract which will serve as the incubation of the seed you got from the school. 

## What is a Smartpy contract? 

A SmartPy contract is the fundamental component of any smart contract application that you build using Smartpy. All variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects/DApps.

## Show me an example: 

A basic contract definition for the contract `Bank` would look like this:

```python
import smartpy as sp

class Bank(sp.Contract):
    pass
```

Explaining the code above: 

1. We first import the `smartpy` library as `sp` as we did in the previous chapter. 
2. We use the Python `class` `to define the basic structure of the `Bank` contract. 
3. To mold this `class` into a smart contract, we use the concept of class inheritance to inherit from `sp.Contract`. Think of this as giving smart contract superpowers to your code. 

## Put it to code: 
Let us create the basic structure of the crypto plant, which will be evolving in the coming chapters!

Steps:

1. Declare a `class` named Plant.
2. Extend the Plant class by inheriting `sp.Contract` from the `smartpy` library.
