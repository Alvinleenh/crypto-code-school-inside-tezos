Python doesn't have concepts of structures so to compensate for the same, smartPy has Records which act as structs. This not only makes the contract more readable and understandable but also makes it much more logical.

Records in smartPy contract are declared in the following manner `Record = sp.record()`

## Put it to code

1) Remove the various Plant attributes which were initialized earlier and also `attack` and `defense` functions as these functions will need to be updated.

2) Create a variable named `stat` which is a record containing the values of all the attributes of your Plant
```python
self.init(stat = sp.record(
name = sp.string(name),
attack = sp.int(70),
defence = sp.int(30),
health = sp.int(100),
growth_rate = sp.int(10),
is_alive = True,
power_move = sp.pair("Bullet Seed", 95))
```
