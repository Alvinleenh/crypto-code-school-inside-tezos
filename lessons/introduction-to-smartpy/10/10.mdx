Python doesn't have concepts of structures so to compensate for the same, smartPy has Records which act as structs. This not only makes the contract more readable and understandable but also makes it much more logical.

Records in smartPy contract are declared in the following manner `Record = sp.record()`

## Put it to code

1) Remove the various Plant attributes which were initialized earlier,

2) Remove statements in `attack()` and `defence()`, as we remove state variables and `pass` the functions. These functions will be updated in the upcoming lessons,

3) Remove `name` variable from `__init__`, as you will be providing name to your Plant explicitly later on,

4) Create a variable named `stat` of type `sp.TRecords` which contains all the previously initialized attributes of your Plant

```python
self.init(stat = sp.record(name = sp.string(name), attack = sp.int(10), defence = sp.int(10), health = sp.int(100), growth_rate = sp.int(10), is_alive = True))
```
