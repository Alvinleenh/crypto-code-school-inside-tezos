SmartPy has `sp.TBool`: The type of boolean values, True, False, sp.bool(True) and sp.bool(False)

In smartPy, all the bitwise operators work the same way as in python, so for example, `True == ~False` is correct in smartPy as well.

## Put it to code

Your Plant is alive as its health is 100, 

1) Declare boolean attribute `is_alive` of type `sp.TBool` with the initial value as `True` inside your contract storage.

```python
is_alive = True
```

**TODO: declare is_alive variable**
