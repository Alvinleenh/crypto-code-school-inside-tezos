SmartPy has `sp.TBool`: The type of boolean values, True, False, sp.bool(True) and sp.bool(False)

In smartPy, all the bitwise operators work the same way as in python, so for example, `True == ~False` is correct in smartPy as well.

**Put it to code**
Your Plant is alive as its health is 100, declare boolean attribute `is_alive` with the initial value as `True`

```python
self.init(..., is_alive = True)
```
