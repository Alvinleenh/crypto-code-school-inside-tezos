If/else statements are the conditional statements which are used to check condition and run the chunk of code only if the conditions are met. 

In smartpy, if/else comamands are `sp.if, sp.else`.

```python
sp.if [condition]:
    # execute code if condition met

sp.else:
    # execute code if condition didn't met
```

You will use these condition statements to check if the sender address is already assigned with a character or not. This will ensure that one user has only one character

## Put it to code

Check if the sender is already assigned

```python
@sp.entry_point
def assignCharacter(self, params):
    sp.if ~ self.data.player.contains(sp.sender):
        self.data.player[sp.sender] = self.data.stat
        self.data.player[sp.sender].name = params.name
    sp.else:
        pass
```
