Entry Point is a method of a contract class that can be called from the outside. They need to be marked with the `@sp.entry_point` decorator. For example the following entry point checks that the argument given is greater than 2 or not.

```python
@sp.entry_point
def checkValue(self, params):
   sp.verify(params.x > 2)
```

## Put it to code
Now let's create shell for attack and defense entry point function for your plant.

1) Declare an empty callable function `attack`,

2) Declare an empty callable function `defense`

**TODO: declare attack and defense entry_point function**
