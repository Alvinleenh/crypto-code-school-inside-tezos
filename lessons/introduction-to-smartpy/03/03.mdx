Chapter Intro: 

In this chapter, we will give our plant a name and store it inside the contract!

Let us break the above down to arrive at what concepts you will be learning: 

1. “Give our plant a name” - we will need to learn about variables. In the space of smart contracts, variables are more commonly referred to as state variables. 
2. “And store it inside the contract” - we will need to learn about the concept of contract storage.  

We will need to learn them in the reverse order since that is how the concepts relate with each other. 

## Concepts we learn in this chapter: 

<br/>

### What is contract storage?
Think of this as your contract’s personal database.

### What are state variables? 
State variables act as a single slot in the “contract storage”. These can be queried and altered by functions inside the contract, which you will be learning in TODO: add link here: <Chapter 9>


## Show me an example:

```python
import smartpy as sp

class Bank(sp.Contract):
    def __init__(self):
        self.init(name = "World Bank")
```

Explaining the code above: 

1. We scaffold the `Bank` contract as we learnt in the previous chapter. 
2. Next, we define an initialization method for `Bank` that determines the initial storage during contract origination. 
3. _init_ calls self.init() which assigns `name`, a state variable, with “World Bank” and stores it inside the “contract storage”

## Coding time!:
Now let us practice what we learned so far on our `Plant` contract`!

Steps: 
1. Define initialization function of your `Plant` contract. 
2. Define `name` variable and initialize it’s value with “peashooter” since that is the name of the species of the plant that you are growing.
