Starting with the absolute basics:

You'll learn how to interact with the smartpy, a python library using in-browser editor. This perfectly simulates how you can interact with a REAL tezos testnet today. In Later lessons, we'll show you how to deploy it to a testnet.

Smart contracts are small programs that are stored and executed on the blockchain, smart contracts in Tezos are unique, as they’re written in Michelson. In addition, Tezos supports formal verification, which guarantees the correctness of smart contract code with respect to a specification. Smart contract code can be proved mathematically according to certain properties. Using formal verification, the Tezos project makes smart contracts more secure and reliable.
 — all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects.

We define a Python class lets call it `HelloWorld` that inherits from the `Contract` class of SmartPy. This class will represent our smart contract and enclose all of the storage initialization, entry points.

An empty contract named HelloWorld would look like this:
```python
class HelloWorld(sp.Contract):
    pass
```

## Put it to code

Putting it together, here is a bare-bones starting contract — the first thing you'll write every time you create a new contract:

1) Declare a class named Plant,

2) Extend smartpy contract
