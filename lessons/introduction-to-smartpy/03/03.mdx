Great job! 

Now that we've got a basic `contract` for `Plant` down, we have the foundation ready to give the plant attributes like name, health, normal moves, special moves that give it the ability to fight with the zombies! 

Let us start small and give our plant a name first, before moving to the exciting attributes like special moves! ðŸ˜‰

In order to achieve our goal of giving plant the name, we need to learn

1. how to initialize our `Plant` contract with a constructor? 
1. how to pass a `name` variable to our constructor function?


```
Todo: 
Split initilization and variables into 2 parts. 
```

## What are state variables? 
State variables are permanently stored in contract storage. This means they're written to the Tezos blockchain. Think of them like writing to a DB.

Variables have types that determines the values that the variable can have and the operations that can be performed on it.

Though one of the great benefits of using SmartPy in writing smart contracts is that SmartyPy does most of type inference under the hood. Just like in Python, most of the of the time there is no need to specify types while writing smart contracts using SmartPy. 

In practice this means that information about an expression is gathered according to its usage. 

For example, when somewhere in your contract you write: 

```python
    self.data.x == "abc"
```
SmartPy will automatically determine and remember that `self.data.x` is a `string`.


## How to initialize our contract with state variables? 

An example of constructor function: 

```python
class Shoe(sp.Contract):    
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.init(brand = brand)
```


Let's dig deep on what we are doing above: 

1. We define an initialization method for `HelloWorld` that determines the initial storage during contract origination. 
2. `__init__()` accepts one argument, `brand` and calls `self.init()` to assign its value to the newly-created `brand` variable field. 

```
Todo + Feedback: 
1. Explain type coercion? like name = sp.string(name)
2. How best to explain types given people are from python background. 
```

## Put it to code: 

<br /> 

1. Declare an `__init__` function in the plant class to initialize the class. 
2. Pass a parameter `name` in the initialization function. 
3. Declare a state variable `name` and initialize it with the class parameter `name`. 

<br /> 

Note: 
Since we know our intentions beforehand that we want to give the `Plant` a name which will be of type string, when the contract is initialized, SmartPy will automatically figure out that `name` is of type `sp.TString`.
