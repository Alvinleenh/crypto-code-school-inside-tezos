Continuing with adding attributes to our `Plant` contract, this chapter deals with adding more exciting attributes. Namely we will be adding the following attributes: 

1. Health: an indicator of the current health of the plant. 
   * Ranges from 0 to 100 where 0 = dead and 100 = full health. 
2. Attack: a qualitative indicator of plant's attack capability for comparing various plants. 
3. Defense:  a qualitative indicator of plant's defense capability for comparing various plants.
4. Growth Rate: rate at which the plant evolves. 


Since these attributes will be defined using integers, we will learn how to handle them inside SmartPy. 


## How SmartPy handles integers: 

<br /> 
There are three types of integers in SmartPy: 

 - sp.TInt: The type of integer values, e.g: `sp.int(-42)`.
 - sp.TNat: The type of non-negative integer values, e.g: `sp.nat(42)`.
 - sp.TIntOrNat: The type of integer values whose type is still undetermined between sp.TInt or sp.TNat, eg: `sp.intOrNat(42)`. 


An example of defining an state variable with an non-negative integer: 

```python
    self.data.age == sp.nat(42)
```


## Put it to code:

<br /> 

1. Declare the following state variables with type `sp.TNat`: 
    * `health`
    * `attack` 
    * `defense`, 
    * `growth_rate` 
2. Initialize all the above with the values of 10, 10, 10, 100 respectively.
