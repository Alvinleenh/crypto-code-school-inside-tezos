### Intro: 

In this chapter, we will start to lay down the foundation of our `Plant` contract! 

Throughout the course, you will be evolving your `Plant` by building in abilities that help it in fighting zombies! 



## Study Time: 

### What is a Smartpy contract? 
A SmartPy contract is the fundamental component of any smart contract application that you build using Smartpy. 

All variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects/DApps.

### Show me an example: 
A basic contract definition for the contract `Bank` would look like this:

```python
import smartpy as sp

class Bank(sp.Contract):
    pass
```

Explaining the code above: 

1. We first import the `smartpy` library as `sp` as we did in the previous chapter. 
2. We use the Python `class` to define the basic structure of the `Bank` contract. 
3. To mold this `class` into a smart contract, we use the concept of class inheritance to inherit from `sp.Contract`. 

Think of this as `smartpy` library lending smart contract superpowers to a basic Python's `class`!

## #buidl-ing time:
Let us create the our `Plant`'s basic contract structure by doing the following: 

1. Declare a `class` named `Plant`.
2. Extend the `Plant` class by inheriting `sp.Contract` from the `smartpy` library.
