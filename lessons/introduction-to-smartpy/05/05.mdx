### Intro:

In this chapter, we will give our plant a name and store it inside the contract!

Let us break the above down to arrive at what concepts you will be learning: 

1. “Give our plant a name” - we will need to learn about variables. In the world of smart contracts, variables are more commonly referred to as state variables. 
2. “And store it inside the contract” - we will need to learn about the concept of contract storage.  


Let's learn them in the reverse order since that is how the concepts relate with each other. 


## Study Time: 

### What is contract storage?

Think of this as your contract’s personal database. Here is where your variables current state get stored. 

When you deploy the contract on the blockchain, this storage becomes part of the global storage of all the contracts in the world! 


## What are state variables? 

State variables act as a single slot in the "contract storage”. 

These can be queried and altered by functions inside the contract, which will be learning in [Chapter 7.](/Xkhpi7kAQQykEYbuY4_OsA)

### Show me an example:

```python
import smartpy as sp

class Bank(sp.Contract):
    def __init__(self):
        self.init(name = "World Bank")

```

Explaining the code above: 

1. We scaffold the `Bank` contract as we had learnt in the previous chapter. 
2. Next, using `__init__` we define an initialization method for `Bank` that determines the initial storage during contract origination. 
3. `_init_` calls `self.init()` which assigns `name`, a state variable, with “World Bank” and stores it inside the “contract storage”. 


### Python concept refresher:

## #buidl-ing time:
Now let us practise what we learned so far and give a name to `Plant` contract`!

1. Using `__init__`, define the initialization function of your `Plant` contract. 
2. Define `name` variable and initialize it’s value with “peashooter” since that is the name of the species of the plant that you are growing.
