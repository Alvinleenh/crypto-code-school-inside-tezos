In this chapter, we are going to add `is_alive` attribute to check whether the plant is alive or not. This will allow us to easily check whether the plant is alive or dead if the Zombies got to it!

As you can see, this is a going to be a boolean value and hence in this chapter we will learn how Smartpy handles the `boolean` type. 

## How SmartPy handles boolean values?
<br /> 

SmartPy has `sp.TBool`:

* `True` is handled as `sp.bool(True)`
* `False` is handled as `sp.bool(False)`

In SmartPy, all the bitwise operators work the same way as in python, so for example, `True == ~False` is correct in SmartPy as well.

## Put it to code: 

<br /> 

1. Declare boolean attribute `is_alive` 
2. Initilize with `True` inside your contract storage.
