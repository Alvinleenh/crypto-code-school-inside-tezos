The arithmetic operators +, -, *, %, // behave just like in Python.

In SmartPy, type inference of arithmetic operators imposes that both sides have the same type.

> For example, If zombie attack your plant, the plant's health will decrease.
`self.data.health -= params.attack`, here both attack and health is assumed to be of type int.

## Put it to code
Complete the attack and defense functions and upgrade attack and defense of your plant.

1) Pass 2 parameters `self` and `params` in `attack` and `defense` functions,

2) Add `attack` points in the state variable `attack` using `self.data.attack += params.attack` in `attack` function,

3) Add `defense` points in the state variable `defense` using `self.data.defense += params.defense` in `defense` function,
