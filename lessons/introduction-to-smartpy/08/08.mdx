### Intro: 
As readers familiar with Python would know that Python is a dynamically typed language. This is in contrast to languages like C, Rust, OCaml (the language with which Tezos blockchain is built in) which are statically typed languages. 

For example, let us contrast how one would define a variable that stores the number 5 in C and Python. 

C Code: 

```cpp
int number = 5
```

Python Code: 

```python
number = 5
```

As you can see, in Python you don’t need to define the type of `number` beforehand. The compiler does the heavy lifting to infer types for you. 

For more information on type checking in Python, we recommend skimming through this [article](https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/). 


## Study Time: 

### Why bother learning about types? 
Just like in Python, most of the time there is no need to specify the types in SmartPy. For a number of reasons (e.g. because SmartPy’s target language, Michelson, requires types), each SmartPy expression does however need a type.

While most of the time you will not write many types explicitly it is beneficial to at least have a basic understanding of what they are. 

**Understanding of types in Smartpy greatly helps in understanding & debugging error messages while writing smart contracts.**

### How does Smartpy deal with types? 
SmartPy uses type inference in order to determine each expression's type. In practice this means that information about an expression is gathered according to its usage. 

Remember, that in Chapter 5 we learnt how to give our `Plant` a name?

```python
class Plant(sp.Contract):
   def __init__(self):
       self.init(name = "peashooter")
```

Here, Smartpy automatically determines and remembers that `name` is a variable that has `string` data type
