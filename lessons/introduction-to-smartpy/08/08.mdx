The arithmetic operators +, -, *, %, // behave just like in Python.

In SmartPy, type inference of arithmetic operators imposes that both sides have the same type.

> For example, If zombie attack your plant, the plant's health will decrease.
`self.data.health -= params.attack`, here both attack and health is assumed to be of type int.

## Put it to code
Complete the attack and defence functions and upgrade attack and defence of your plant.

```python
@sp.entry_point
def attack(self, params):
    self.data.attack += params.attack

@sp.entry_point
def defense(self, params):
    self.data.defense += params.defense
```

**TODO: add functionality for attack and defence entry_point function**
