The arithmetic operators +, -, *, %, // behave just like in Python.

In SmartPy, type inference of arithmetic operators imposes that both sides have the same type.

> For example, If zombie attack your plant, the plant's health will decrease.
`self.data.health -= params.attack`

**Put it to do**(Continuing from previous state)
Complete the attack and defence functions and upgrade attack and defence of your plant.

```python
@sp.entry_point
def attack(self, params):
    self.data.attack += params.attack

@sp.entry_point
def defense(self, params):
    self.data.defense += params.defense
```
